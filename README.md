# 🌊 EAFM-Enhanced: Environment Agency Flood Monitoring (Enhanced)

**EAFME** is a feature-rich, "context-aware" fork of the official Home Assistant Environment Agency integration.

While the original integration provides essential raw data, **EAFME** is designed to provide actionable intelligence—telling you not just *how high* the river is, but what that level actually means for your local area.

## 🚀 Key Improvements in this Fork

### 1. 🆔 Fix: Duplicate Station Support

The original integration can struggle with "Station Shadowing." If two stations share the same name (e.g., "The Weir"), the original integration often only displays one, or fails to list the second.

* **The EAFM2 Solution:** We use unique RLOI IDs and Catchment names in the selection process. This ensures that every single gauge in the UK is selectable, even if there are 10 others with the same name.

### 2. 🚦 Automated "River Status" Sensor

We've added a dedicated "Status" entity that categorizes the river's health in real-time:

* 🟢 **Normal**: Water levels are within the expected seasonal range.
* 🔴 **High**: Levels have exceeded the typical high threshold for this specific gauge.
* 🟡 **Low**: Levels are below the typical low threshold.

### 3. 🔍 Deep Metadata Fetching

EAFM2 doesn't just scrape the surface. It follows secondary API links to find "Stage Scale" data, providing you with:

* **Typical High/Low Thresholds** (now available as attributes).
* **Highest Recent Reading** (compare today's level to the last major flood).

### Pro Dashboard Tip

You can now create a **Badge** on your Home Assistant dashboard that changes color based on the `sensor.[station]_river_status`. It makes it incredibly easy to see if you need to check the river at a single glance.
